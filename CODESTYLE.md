## Risks and assumptions

- Assumptions: Contributors can run ESLint and TypeScript locally.
- Risks / blast radius: Inconsistent style reduces maintainability.
- Rollback / recovery: Revert style changes that break builds.

## Prerequisites

- Required: Node.js 20+, pnpm
- Optional: Editor ESLint integration

## Quickstart

### 1) Run lint and type checks

```sh
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
```

### 2) Verify

Expected output:

- Both commands exit with status 0.

## Common tasks

### Keep files small and focused

- What you get: Easier reviews and maintenance.
- Steps:

```sh
# Keep files under ~300 lines and functions under ~30 lines when practical.
```

- Verify: The file still reads clearly in a single screen.

### Use one main concept per file

- What you get: Predictable project structure.
- Steps:

```sh
# Prefer one component, hook, or type per file unless the type is trivial.
```

- Verify: File names map to exported symbols.

### Follow existing naming and casing

- What you get: Consistent imports and paths.
- Steps:

```sh
# Match existing casing in src/ and avoid new conventions.
```

- Verify: No unnecessary renames or churn.

## Troubleshooting

### Symptom: ESLint errors block a change

Cause: Violations of project lint rules.
Fix: Update code to satisfy `pnpm lint` output.

### Symptom: TypeScript build fails

Cause: Type errors in new or refactored code.
Fix: Address type errors or adjust typings.

### Symptom: File grows too large

Cause: Multiple concepts in one file.
Fix: Split into smaller modules.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `pnpm lint` passes without warnings.
- [ ] `pnpm typecheck` passes.
- [ ] New files follow existing naming conventions.
- [ ] Files stay small and focused.
