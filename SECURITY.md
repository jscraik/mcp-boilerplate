## Risks and assumptions

- Assumptions: Maintainers can receive private reports and rotate secrets.
- Risks / blast radius: Leaked credentials, auth bypass, or payment misuse.
- Rollback / recovery: Revoke credentials, patch, and redeploy.

## Prerequisites

- Required: A private channel for security reporting (<jscraik@brainwav.io>)
- Optional: Public disclosure timeline policy

## Quickstart

### 1) Report a security issue privately

Send a report to <jscraik@brainwav.io> that includes:

- Steps to reproduce
- Affected versions or commits
- Impact assessment

### 2) Maintain triage timeline

Acknowledge within 3 business days (confirm) and provide updates until resolved.

### 3) Verify

Expected output:

- Reporter receives confirmation and a status update.

## Common tasks

### Report a vulnerability

- What you get: A private channel for coordinated disclosure.
- Steps:

```sh
# If hosted on GitHub, use Security Advisories.
# Otherwise, contact jscraik@brainwav.io.
```

- Verify: Maintainer confirms receipt.

### Rotate credentials after a leak

- What you get: Replacement tokens and revoked secrets.
- Steps:

```sh
# Rotate OAuth secrets, Stripe keys, and cookie encryption keys.
```

- Verify: Services authenticate with new secrets only.

## Troubleshooting

### Symptom: No response to a report

Cause: Security contact not configured.
Fix: Set a maintainer-owned contact and update this file.

### Symptom: Sensitive issue disclosed publicly

Cause: Reporter did not have a private channel.
Fix: Add clear private reporting instructions.

### Symptom: Fixes cannot be verified

Cause: No reproduction steps or environment details.
Fix: Request a minimal reproduction from the reporter.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] A private security contact is configured and published.
- [ ] Triage and response timelines are defined.
- [ ] Secret rotation steps are documented.
- [ ] Disclosure process is clear and consistent.
