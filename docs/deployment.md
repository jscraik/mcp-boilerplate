## Risks and assumptions

- Assumptions: `wrangler.jsonc` contains valid bindings and KV IDs.
- Risks / blast radius: Invalid bindings can break auth or billing.
- Rollback / recovery: Redeploy a known-good version and rotate secrets.

## Prerequisites

- Required: Cloudflare account, Wrangler CLI, valid `.env` values
- Optional: Test Stripe keys and OAuth provider credentials

## Quickstart

### 1) Build the project

```sh
pnpm build
```

### 2) Deploy to Cloudflare

```sh
pnpm deploy
```

### 3) Verify

Expected output:

- Wrangler reports a successful deploy.
- The worker URL responds to `/mcp` requests.

## Common tasks

### Deploy in one step

- What you get: Build + deploy in a single command.
- Steps:

```sh
pnpm build-deploy
```

- Verify: Build and deploy both succeed.

### Dry-run deploy checks

- What you get: A deployment validation without publishing.
- Steps:

```sh
pnpm check
```

- Verify: The dry run exits with status 0.

### Update KV namespaces

- What you get: Valid KV binding IDs for auth state.
- Steps:

```sh
pnpm wrangler kv namespace create OAUTH_KV
pnpm wrangler kv namespace create OAUTH_KV --preview
```

- Verify: IDs are copied into `wrangler.jsonc`.

## Troubleshooting

### Symptom: Deploy fails with missing bindings

Cause: KV or Durable Object bindings are incorrect.
Fix: Update `wrangler.jsonc` with correct IDs.

### Symptom: Worker starts but assets are missing

Cause: `dist/client` assets were not built.
Fix: Run `pnpm build` before deploy.

### Symptom: Auth fails in production

Cause: Production `.env` values differ from local test values.
Fix: Verify secrets and URLs in Cloudflare environment settings.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Build completes without errors.
- [ ] Deploy succeeds and returns a worker URL.
- [ ] `/mcp` responds with expected behavior.
- [ ] KV namespaces are configured for preview and production.

## Evidence bundle

- Lint outputs (Vale/markdownlint/link check): Not run (no configs found).
- Brand check output: Not run (no brand check script found).
- Readability output (if available): Not run (no readability script found).
- Checklist snapshot: Pending maintainer confirmation.

## Reference

- Worker config: `wrangler.jsonc`
- Build scripts: `package.json`
- Environment variables: `docs/configuration.md`
