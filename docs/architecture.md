## Risks and assumptions

- Assumptions: Cloudflare Workers, Durable Objects, and KV are available.
- Risks / blast radius: Auth or billing bugs can block all requests.
- Rollback / recovery: Redeploy a previous build and rotate secrets.

## Prerequisites

- Required: Familiarity with TypeScript and Cloudflare Workers
- Optional: Stripe and OAuth provider knowledge

## Quickstart

### 1) Locate the main entry points

- Worker entry: `src/worker/index.ts`
- MCP server: `src/worker/mcp.ts`
- Routes: `src/worker/routes.ts`

### 2) Verify

Expected output:

- You can trace requests from `index.ts` to route handlers and tools.

## Common tasks

### Add a new MCP tool

- What you get: A new tool registered with the MCP server.
- Steps:

```sh
# Add a file under src/tools/free/ or src/tools/paid/ and register it in src/tools/index.ts
```

- Verify: The tool is present in the server registration logs.

### Add an authentication provider

- What you get: A new OAuth provider flow.
- Steps:

```sh
# Add a provider under src/auth/ and wire it into routing in src/worker/routes.ts
```

- Verify: The new auth route is reachable and returns expected redirects.

### Add a billing feature

- What you get: A new paid tool or entitlement check.
- Steps:

```sh
# Update src/billing/stripe.ts and paid tool registration in src/tools/paid/
```

- Verify: Stripe checkout can be initiated in a test environment.

## Troubleshooting

### Symptom: Routes are not reachable

Cause: Route not registered in `src/worker/routes.ts`.
Fix: Add the route and ensure it is included in the router.

### Symptom: Tools are missing

Cause: Tool file not imported in `src/tools/index.ts`.
Fix: Register the tool in the appropriate index module.

### Symptom: UI widgets do not appear

Cause: Missing route file under `src/app/routes/`.
Fix: Add the route HTML file and rebuild.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Key entry points are documented.
- [ ] Component boundaries are clear.
- [ ] Tool, auth, billing, and UI layers are described.
- [ ] Troubleshooting covers top failure modes.

## Evidence bundle

- Lint outputs (Vale/markdownlint/link check): Not run (no configs found).
- Brand check output: Not run (no brand check script found).
- Readability output (if available): Not run (no readability script found).
- Checklist snapshot: Pending maintainer confirmation.

## Reference

- Worker entry: `src/worker/index.ts`
- Auth providers: `src/auth/`
- Billing: `src/billing/`
- UI app: `src/app/`
