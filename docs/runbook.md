## Risks and assumptions

- Assumptions: A deployed worker is reachable and logs are accessible.
- Risks / blast radius: Auth or billing failures can block all traffic.
- Rollback / recovery: Redeploy a known-good build and rotate secrets.

## Prerequisites

- Required: Access to Cloudflare dashboard and Wrangler CLI
- Optional: Stripe dashboard access for webhook validation

## Quickstart

### 1) Perform a basic health check

- Confirm the worker URL responds and `/mcp` returns a non-5xx response.

### 2) Verify

Expected output:

- Worker responses are within normal latency and no new errors appear in logs.
- `/mcp` does not return 5xx responses.

## Common tasks

### Investigate authentication failures

- What you get: Confirmation of auth configuration health.
- Steps:

```sh
# Check OAUTH_ISSUER and OAUTH_JWKS_URI values in the environment.
```

- Verify: Tokens validate against JWKS.

### Validate Stripe webhooks

- What you get: Confirmation of billing events.
- Steps:

```sh
# Check STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET and Stripe dashboard event logs.
```

- Verify: Webhooks are acknowledged without signature errors.

### Emergency rollback

- What you get: A known-good deployment.
- Steps:

```sh
# Redeploy the previous known-good commit and rotate secrets if needed.
```

- Verify: Errors stop and expected behavior returns.

## Troubleshooting

### Symptom: Elevated 401/403 rates

Cause: OAuth issuer or JWKS misconfiguration.
Fix: Recheck OAuth configuration and redeploy.

### Symptom: Billing events missing

Cause: Stripe webhook misconfiguration.
Fix: Verify webhook endpoint and signing secret.

### Symptom: Worker errors after deploy

Cause: Configuration drift or missing bindings.
Fix: Compare `wrangler.jsonc` with production settings and redeploy.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Health checks are defined and repeatable.
- [ ] Auth and billing checks are documented.
- [ ] Rollback steps are available.
- [ ] On-call ownership is assigned.
