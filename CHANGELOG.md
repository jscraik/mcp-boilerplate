## Risks and assumptions

- Assumptions: Releases are tagged and notes are curated.
- Risks / blast radius: Missing breaking changes can break downstream users.
- Rollback / recovery: Update notes and publish a corrective release.

## Prerequisites

- Required: A tagging or release process (configure this)
- Optional: Automated changelog tooling

## Quickstart

### 1) Record a change

Use these categories:

- Added
- Changed
- Deprecated
- Removed
- Fixed
- Security

### 2) Verify

Expected output:

- Each release entry includes a date and migration notes when needed.

## Common tasks

### Add an entry for a release

- What you get: Clear release notes for users.
- Steps:

```sh
# Edit this file under the next release heading.
```

- Verify: Changes are in the correct category.

### Mark a breaking change

- What you get: Clear migration guidance.
- Steps:

```sh
# Add details under "Changed" or "Removed" and include migration steps.
```

- Verify: Users can follow the migration steps.

## Troubleshooting

### Symptom: Users are surprised by breaking changes

Cause: Missing or incomplete migration notes.
Fix: Add explicit migration steps and highlight the change.

### Symptom: No version tags exist

Cause: Release process not defined.
Fix: Define a tagging convention and update this file.

### Symptom: Release notes are inconsistent

Cause: No standard format or owner.
Fix: Follow the categories above and assign an owner.
